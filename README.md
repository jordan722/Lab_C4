* Group Initial Feedback
- I believe the group used about the same level of detail as our project.
  However, I believe both our write up and this group's write up could
  use a bit more details and specific examples.
- The group provided specific details, such as function names, but did not
  provide details for implementation. The write up seems to be enough to work with but would require a decent amount of conjecture.
- The group did not provide any clear way for the project to be split
  between a group of 3 members.
- The group provided some specific details for the start of the game,
  but did not provide much information for dealing with end game situations,
  such as what to do when a user wins or loses.



* Thoughts after writing code
- For my part of the project, I attempted to write the checkWin() function.
- The first thing I noticed was that the group incorrectly stated that the
  function should accept a boolean. The group, therefore, did not actually
  provide the correct inputs the function should take.
- The group also did not define what the size of each board would be.
- The group also did not provide a specific implementation.
- Overall, I think it would have been helpful if the group provided more
  guidance for this particular section.
